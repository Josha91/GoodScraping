# GoodScraping
Some simple scripts to play around with webscraping a bit. Specifically, this is applied to Goodreads.
Required python packages include `selenium`, `pandas`, `seaborn` and `beautifulSoup`

In the example below, I collect information about Asterix & Obelix albums. The figure shows the average Goodreads rating of each album.

The colors indicate different writer/artist duos. Different average scores in different eras are immediately apparent.
